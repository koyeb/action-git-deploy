# Koyeb Deploy GitHub Action

This action builds and deploys an application from a GitHub repository or Docker registry to Koyeb.

## Usage

Before you can use the Koyeb Deploy Action, you first need to install and configure the Koyeb CLI.

```yaml
- name: Install and configure the Koyeb CLI
  uses: koyeb-community/koyeb-actions@v2
  with:
    api_token: "${{ secrets.KOYEB_API_TOKEN }}"
```

Make sure to [set the `KOYEB_API_TOKEN` secret in your repository](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets). To generate a Koyeb token, go to the [**API access tokens** settings in the Koyeb control panel](https://app.koyeb.com/settings/api).

After the step that installs the Koyeb CLI, add the following step to your workflow:

```yaml
- name: Build and deploy the application to Koyeb
  uses: koyeb/action-git-deploy@v1
  with:
    service-env: PORT=8000
    service-ports: "8000:http"
    service-routes: "/:8000"
```

The `service-env`, `service-ports`, and `service-routes` parameters are optional, but should match the needs of your application.  The defaults provided are unlikely to work for most applications.

## Optional Parameters

The following optional parameters can be added to the `with` block:

## Example: deploying a service to Koyeb

```yaml
name: Deploy to Koyeb

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - '*'

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    concurrency:
      group: "${{ github.ref_name }}"
      cancel-in-progress: true
    steps:
      - name: Install and configure the Koyeb CLI
        uses: koyeb-community/koyeb-actions@v2
        with:
          api_token: "${{ secrets.KOYEB_API_TOKEN }}"

      - name: Build and deploy the application to Koyeb
        uses: koyeb/action-git-deploy@v1
        with:
          app-name: my-koyeb-app
          service-name: my-koyeb-service
          service-env: FOO=bar,BAZ=qux
          service-ports: "80:http,8080:http"
          service-routes: "/api:80,/docs:8080"
          service-checks: "8000:http:/,8001:tcp"
```

## Use secrets

Previously, we showed how to configure environment variables for your projects. For secrets variables, you can first create a Koyeb secret with the [`action-git-deploy/secret` action](https://github.com/koyeb/action-git-deploy/blob/master/secret/action.yaml):

```yaml
- name: Create application secret
  uses: koyeb/action-git-deploy/secret@v1
  with:
    secret-name: MY_SECRET
    secret-value: "${{ secrets.DATABASE_URL }}"
```

Afterwards, you can use this secret as an environment variable for your service:

```yaml
- name: Build and deploy the application to Koyeb
  uses: koyeb/action-git-deploy@v1
  with:
    [...]
    service-env: ENV_VAR=@MY_SECRET
```

## Cleaning up Services

After deploying a service to Koyeb, you may want to remove it when it is no longer needed. To do this, you can use the [`koyeb/action-git-deploy/cleanup` action](https://github.com/koyeb/action-git-deploy/blob/master/cleanup/action.yaml). Here's an example of how to use this action:

```yaml
- name: Install and configure the Koyeb CLI
  uses: koyeb-community/koyeb-actions@v2
  with:
    api_token: "${{ secrets.KOYEB_API_TOKEN }}"

- name: Clean up Koyeb Service
  uses: koyeb/action-git-deploy/cleanup@v1
```

The first step installs the CLI, which is required to remove the service. The second step performs the cleanup. Optionally, you can provide the `app-name` parameter (which defaults to `<repo>/<branch>`) to specify the name of the application to remove.

### Example: removing a service when a ref is deleted

To remove a Koyeb service when a branch or tag is deleted, you can use the delete event in your workflow file. Here's an example of how to do this:

```yaml
name: Cleanup Koyeb application

on:
  delete:
    branches:
      - '*'

jobs:
  cleanup:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Install and configure the Koyeb CLI
        uses: koyeb-community/koyeb-actions@v2
        with:
          api_token: "${{ secrets.KOYEB_API_TOKEN }}"

      - name: Cleanup Koyeb application
        uses: koyeb/action-git-deploy/cleanup@v1
```

In this example, the workflow listens for any branch or tag that is deleted using the `'*'` wildcard. When a delete event occurs, the cleanup job runs and uses the `koyeb/action-git-deploy/cleanup` action to remove the corresponding Koyeb service. Be sure to set `KOYEB_API_TOKEN` as a repository secret.
